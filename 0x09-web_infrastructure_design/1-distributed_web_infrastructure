Explanations:

1. Load Balancer (HAProxy):
   Distributes traffic to multiple application servers to balance load.
2. Application Servers (2x):
   Each has NGINX, application files, and handles client requests.
3. Database (MySQL Primary):
   Single DB instance handling both reads and writes.

Load Balancer Algorithm:

- Round-Robin: Sends incoming requests alternately to available servers.

Active-Active Setup:

- Both app servers actively handle requests at the same time.

Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave):

- Not implemented in this task, but would involve a Primary node handling writes and Replicas handling reads.

Infrastructure Issues:

- SPOF at Load Balancer and Database.
- No Firewall or HTTPS â€” insecure communication.
- No monitoring to detect failures proactively.
