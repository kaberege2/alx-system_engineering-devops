Explanations:

1. Server:
   A physical or virtual machine that hosts the website, containing the web server, application server, and database.
2. Domain Name:
   Human-readable name (foobar.com) that maps to the server's IP via DNS.
3. DNS Record (A Record):
   Points www.foobar.com to the serverâ€™s IP (8.8.8.8).
4. Web Server (NGINX):
   Handles HTTP requests, serves static content, forwards dynamic requests to the app server.
5. Application Server:
   Processes dynamic requests (PHP, Python) and communicates with the database.
6. Database (MySQL):
   Stores website data persistently.
7. Communication Protocol:
   HTTP over TCP/IP between client browser and server.

Infrastructure Issues:

- Single Point of Failure (SPOF): One server means total failure if it crashes.
- Downtime on Deployment: Restarting services will cause temporary downtime.
- Scalability: Cannot handle high traffic without adding more servers.
