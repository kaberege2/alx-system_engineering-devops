Explanations:

1. Load Balancer Cluster (HAProxy x2):
   Removes Load Balancer SPOF by clustering.
2. Separate Web Servers:
   Handle static content requests.
3. Separate Application Servers:
   Process dynamic content separately from Web Servers.
4. Database Cluster (Primary-Replica):
   Primary handles writes, Replicas handle read queries for load distribution.

Reason for Splitting Components:

- Allows scaling Web/App/DB layers independently.
- Improves performance and fault isolation.
